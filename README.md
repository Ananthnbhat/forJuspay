Note:I was given 2 days of time(2nd and 3rd October) in which I worked very,very hard since only recently I had started learning web technologies.So I had to learn lot of things in 2 days.Couldn't concentrate on the design part,because I thought if the project is not working at all,designing is of no use.If I had had a little more time I would have done that too and I know the complete logic of how to implement all the functionalities given in the problem statement.I really want to work in juspay because I dont think there is any company I know of,which supports both music(people say I am a really good singer,please see my resume if possible) and work as well.So,I request you to give me another assignment if this project is not satisfactory.
